# EditorConfig
A Swift library for working with [editorconfig][editorconfig] files

## Contributing and Collaboration

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

## Suggestions and Feedback

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mattiem), an issue, or a pull request.
